# Epoch-Spring-Camp-Unsupervised-Learning
This is a GitHub Repository for the Epoch Spring Camp Unsupervised Learning Task of implementing K-means Clustering from scratch

**Problem Statement:**

**Objective**  

You have been provided with a dataset containing information about various pincodes across India, including their corresponding longitudes and latitudes (clustering_data.csv). Your task is to focus specifically on the pincodes of your home state. Hereâ€™s what you need to do:  

**1. Data Filtering:**  

Extract the entries corresponding to your home state from the dataset. Ensure you accurately filter out only those pincodes that belong to your home state.  

**2. Data Visualization:**  

You can utilize the longitude and latitude data to plot the geographical locations of these pincodes on a map (get creative!). This will help in visualizing the distribution of the pincodes across your state.  

**3. Clustering Analysis:**  

Implement the k-means clustering algorithm from scratch (do not use any pre-built k-means function).
Apply this algorithm to the longitude and latitude data of your filtered pincodes to identify distinct clusters within your state.  

**4. Inference and Insights:**  

Draw meaningful inferences from your clustering results. Analyze the characteristics of the clusters you identified and provide insights about the geographical distribution and potential implications.  

**5. Visualization and Preprocessing:**  

Use appropriate visualization techniques (like scatter plots, maps, etc.) to illustrate the clusters and any other relevant observations.
Ensure your data is preprocessed correctly before applying the k-means algorithm (this may include handling missing values,checking for duplicates etc.).  

**New Features Added**  
1. For the scatter plot of the Latitude and Longitude using matplotlib , I have tried to make something cool about the plot by making it display all the details regarding that place using external library mplcursors . Here I have added a feature to display all the details of a place when we hover the mouse cursor onto that point on the scatter plot.
2. I have tried to optimize the value of k in the K-Means clustering algorithm . So I have found out the optimal k value by plotting the elbow curve by calculating within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) value for different k values.

**Inferences and Insights:**
